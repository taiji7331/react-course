## Task

1. In this ungraded lab, your goal is to add an image from the `assets` folder that's already been added to the `src` folder. The image should be added into the App component, under the h1 heading, inside the `return` statement. First, you need to import the image. The image should be referred to as `logo`.
2. Inside the return statement, add the new `img` element, with the `src` attribute set to the jsx expression evaluating the `logo` value, and the `alt` attribute holding the string of `"Logo"`.
